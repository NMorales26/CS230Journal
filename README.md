The Gaming Room, a client of Creative Technology Solutions (CTS), wanted to expand their Android game, "Draw It or Lose It," by developing a web-based version. The game is reminiscent of the early 1980s television game "Win, Lose or Draw" and involves teams guessing random phrases based on drawings. The client specified the following requirements: support for multiple teams, unique identification for games, teams, and players, and ensuring that only one game instance exists in memory at any time.

What Was Done Well in Developing this Documentation:
The documentation is comprehensive and well-structured, covering the client's requirements, design constraints, entity classes, relationships, OOP principles, evaluation of various platforms, recommendations, and security considerations. The use of UML diagrams and clear explanations enhances understanding. It effectively addresses the client's needs and offers detailed recommendations for platform choices, architecture, and security.

Helpful Aspects of Working Through the Design Document:
Developing the design document allowed for a structured approach to understanding and translating the client's requirements into a software design. It helped in visualizing the system's architecture, identifying potential challenges, and devising solutions. It also encouraged considering the user's needs and how the design could be implemented to meet them effectively.

Part of the Work to Revise:
One aspect that could be improved is providing more specific details regarding the software's frontend development. While the document emphasizes the backend and server-side aspects, providing insight into frontend technologies, user interfaces, and user experience design could enhance the comprehensiveness of the document.

Interpreting User Needs and Implementing in Design:
Interpreting user needs is vital in designing software because it ensures that the final product meets the expectations and requirements of the target audience. In this case, the client's need was to transition the mobile game to the web, and by considering their requirements for scalability, real-time interaction, and data security, the design aimed to create a web-based game that provided an enjoyable and secure experience for gamers.

Approach to Designing Software:
The approach to designing the software involved understanding the client's requirements, considering design constraints, applying OOP principles, and evaluating platform options. Techniques included creating UML diagrams to visualize the system, making recommendations based on platform analysis, and emphasizing security as a core component. To design a similar software application in the future, I would continue to follow a structured approach, engage in client communication, and keep user needs at the forefront of the design process. Additionally, I would consider frontend design more comprehensively to provide a well-rounded solution.
